This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

-   Fetching data right inside the server component and send data as props to use in client component
-   Use Monaco Editor for code editor
-   Use Prisma for db inside the project
-   Using dynamic paths []
-   Using server actions for changing data
-   Use loading, not found, layout pages
-   Separate file with server aactions

## Notes

-   server actions can not be defined in client components: 1. can be defined in server component and passed as props to client component OR 2. you can create a separate file in the project with server actions that can be exported/imported and used where needed
-   server components can not pass event handlers to client components
-   hooks and event handlers can not be used in server components
